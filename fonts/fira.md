# Install Fira fonts on MacOS

This works on my Macbook with brew installed ( https://brew.sh ).
My Macbook during writing this TIL has macOS 13.0.1

```shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask \
  font-fira-code \
  font-fira-mono \
  font-fira-mono-for-powerline \
  font-fira-sans
```
